# Mask-Detection
Mask Detection project is made using Keras, Tensorflow, MobileNet and OpenCV. With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV cameras to detect and identify people without masks. The model is accurate, and since the MobileNetV2 architecture is used, itâ€™s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).
